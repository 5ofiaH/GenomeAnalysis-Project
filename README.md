# GenomeAnalysis-SHV
Re-analyzing and re-evaluating the biological conclusions from the article "The draft genome of tropical fruit durian (Durio zibethinus)".

## AimðŸŽ¯
The aim of the project is to re-analyze and re-evaluate the biological conclusions from the article "The draft genome of tropical fruit durian (Durio zibethinus)". In this article, the genome sequencing and assembly data of Durio zibethinus was studied, specifically the Musang King cultivar, in order to gain insights into its genetic makeup, evolutionary history, and potential agronomic traits. The research seeks to address questions related to the genetic diversity, structural organization, and functional characteristics of the durian genome, with a focus on understanding the genetic basis of aroma production and fruit ripening.
