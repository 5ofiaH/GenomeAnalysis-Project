# GenomeAnalysis-Project

## Welcome to my Genome Analysis Project :)

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for my genome analysis project focusing on chromosome 6 of the durian genome. The project aims to re-analyze and re-evaluate the biological conclusions from the article "The draft genome of tropical fruit durian (Durio zibethinus)" by Teh et al. (2017), with a particular focus on a subset of the genome.

## Goals

- Re-analyze and re-evaluate the biological conclusions from the original article
- Investigate the genetic structure and diversity of chromosome 6 in the durian genome
- Compare the durian genome with other related plant species
- Identify molecular mechanisms associated with aroma production and fruit ripening
- Conduct differential expression analyses to explore gene regulation patterns

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Includes information about the datasets used in the analysis
- **Scripts**: Contains scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization
- **Results**: Stores the results obtained from different analyses
- **Documentation**: Contains project documentation, including the README file and any additional guides or reports
